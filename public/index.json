It\u0026rsquo;s built into every Linux distribution, requires no extra software, and gives you precise control.\nBut first: a very important warning\ndd is incredibly powerful — and famously dangerous. A single typo (like writing to your hard drive instead of the USB) can permanently erase everything with no warning and no recycle bin. In the Linux community, people half-jokingly call it the \u0026ldquo;disk destroyer\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;delete data\u0026rdquo; command.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll show you exactly how to use it safely in this guide, but always triple-check every command before pressing Enter.\nWhat is dd and what does it stand for? # dd is a standard Unix/Linux shell command designed for low-level copying and conversion of data. It reads from an input source (if=) and writes to an output destination (of=), block by block, while optionally converting the data (e.g., changing character sets, block sizes, or byte order).\nThe name origin # Officially, dd stands for \u0026ldquo;Data Definition\u0026rdquo; (or sometimes \u0026ldquo;Dataset Definition\u0026rdquo;).\nThis is an allusion to the DD statement in IBM\u0026rsquo;s Job Control Language (JCL), used on mainframe systems for defining datasets (files) and their attributes. When Unix was being developed in the early 1970s, the creators borrowed the name and syntax style for this utility. (Source: Dennis Ritchie himself confirmed this in old Usenet posts, and it\u0026rsquo;s documented on Wikipedia and in the GNU Coreutils manual.)\nCommon nicknames you’ll hear:\nDisk Destroyer or Delete Data — because mistakes are catastrophic Data Duplicator or Disk Dumper — more positive spins on its actual purpose Despite the jokes, when used carefully, dd is one of the most trustworthy tools for tasks like:\nWriting ISO files to USB drives Creating exact disk/partition images (backups) Cloning drives Recovering data from failing media In the next sections, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk through the safe, step-by-step process to create a bootable USB from an ISO file using dd — including how to identify your USB correctly, modern best-practice flags, and verification steps.\nStep 1: Identify Your USB Device (The Most Critical Step!) # Before running dd, you must know exactly which device is your USB stick. Getting this wrong is the #1 cause of data loss.\nInsert your USB drive (at least 8 GB recommended; 16–32 GB ideal). Open a terminal and run: lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,RM,MODEL,MOUNTPOINT RM=1 indicates removable media (your USB). Match the size to your drive. Example: NAME SIZE TYPE RM MODEL MOUNTPOINT sda 500G disk 0 Samsung_SSD / sdb 32G disk 1 Kingston_DataTraveler └─sdb1 32G part 1 /run/media/user/USB → Target the whole device (/dev/sdb), not a partition (/dev/sdb1).\nFor extra safety, check persistent names (these survive reboots): ls -l /dev/disk/by-id/ | grep -i usb Example output:\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Feb 13 20:30 usb-Kingston_DataTraveler_3.0_ABC123DEF-0:0 -\u0026gt; ../../sdb → Use /dev/disk/by-id/usb-\u0026hellip; in later commands — it\u0026rsquo;s harder to mistype.\nPro tip: Run lsblk before and after inserting the USB. The new device is your target.\nStep 2: Unmount the USB Device # If the USB auto-mounts (appears in your file manager), unmount it first — writing to a mounted device can fail or corrupt data.\nsudo umount /dev/sdb* 2\u0026gt;/dev/null || true (Replace sdb with your device. * handles all partitions like sdb1/sdb2. Ignore \u0026ldquo;not mounted\u0026rdquo; errors.)\nStep 3: Write the ISO to the USB with dd # Now the main command. Use these modern, safe flags:\nbs=4M — good speed vs. reliability balance status=progress — shows real-time bytes transferred \u0026amp; speed conv=fsync (or oflag=direct,sync) — forces data flush to hardware (prevents early removal corruption)\nRecommended command:\nsudo dd if=/path/to/your.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync Even safer variant (using persistent ID + direct I/O for reliability)\nsudo dd if=~/Downloads/ubuntu-24.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso \\ of=/dev/disk/by-id/usb-Kingston_DataTraveler_3.0_ABC123DEF-0:0 \\ bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync oflag=direct Replace paths/device names! It may take 5-20 minutes (USB 3.0+ is faster). You\u0026rsquo;ll see progress like: 2,345,678,901 bytes (2.3 GB, 2.2 GiB) copied, 142 s, 16.5 MB/s Important: Do not interrupt this (no Ctrl+c unless emergency). Let id finish.\nStep 4: Flush \u0026amp; Safely Remove the USB # After dd completes:\nsync sudo sync # extra flush just in case sudo eject /dev/sdb # or your device Now safely unplug it.\nStep 5: Verify \u0026amp; Test the Bootable USB # Re-insert the USB → run lsblk again. You should see a new partition layout (often 1–3 small ones).\nBoot from it\nRestart your computer. Enter BIOS/UEFI (usually F2, Del, Esc, F12). Set USB as first boot device (or use one-time boot menu: often F12). Disable Secure Boot if needed (for some distros). If it boots to the live/installer → success!\nIf not: Re-check ISO integrity (checksums), try another USB, or test in a VM first.\nCommon Mistakes \u0026amp; How to Avoid Them # Mistake Consequence How to Avoid Wrong of= (e.g. /dev/sda) Wipes main drive Triple-check with lsblk Write to partition (e.g. /dev/sdb1) Non-bootable / corrupted USB Always use whole device (/dev/sdb) Forget to unmount \u0026ldquo;Device busy\u0026rdquo; or corruption Run umount first Pull USB before sync/eject Incomplete write → boot fail Always sync + eject No status=progress Looks frozen Add it every time Tiny bs= (e.g. 512) Very slow write Use bs=4M or bs=1M Alternatives If dd Feels Too Risky # Ventoy — Copy multiple ISOs to one USB (no rewriting needed each time). balenaEtcher or Fedora Media Writer — GUI tools with verification. mkusb — dd wrapper with extra safety checks (great for persistence). dd remains the gold standard for control and universality — just respect its power.

Storage: A mix — KINGSTON 240 GB (current boot + LVM thin pool), multiple 1 TB SSDs (T-FORCE, Fanxiang, SanDisk, WD Blue, HP), one 931 GB HDD, and more raw drives ready for ZFS pools. Role so far: Main workhorse, running most VMs/containers. Node 2: superman (the \u0026ldquo;storage beast\u0026rdquo;)\nCPU: Dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 v2 @ 3.00 GHz\n– 2 sockets × 10 cores × 2 threads = 40 threads total (slightly faster clocks) RAM: 125 GiB (~128 GB) total — still plenty. Storage: Massive! Multiple 12.7 TB drives (OOS14000G, Seagate Exos), 10.9 TB drives, 3.6 TB Seagates, 1.8 TB drives — perfect for bulk/Ceph/ZFS replication. Role so far: Secondary node for replication, backups, and future HA. Both on Proxmox VE (latest as of 2026), same version, static IPs on the same LAN.\nWhy Cluster Them? # Centralized management (one web UI for both). Live migration of VMs between nodes. Shared view of storage/VMs. Future HA (high availability) for critical services. Easy replication/backups across nodes.
